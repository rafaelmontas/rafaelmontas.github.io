A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several
kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.

In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",

color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft
flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow,
red, purple, or brown when ripe.
